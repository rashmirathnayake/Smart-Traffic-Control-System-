## Smart Traffic Control System

### Overview
The Smart Traffic Control System is an intelligent solution designed to enhance traffic management and optimize signal control at intersections. Leveraging object detection techniques, this system aims to improve safety, reduce congestion, and provide real-time insights for traffic engineers and city planners.

### Key Features
1. **Object Detection**:
   - Utilizes state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN) to identify vehicles, pedestrians, and other relevant objects in live camera feeds.
   - Real-time processing ensures timely responses to changing traffic conditions.

2. **Intersection Control**:
   - Dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on detected objects and traffic flow.
   - Prioritizes emergency vehicles, buses, and pedestrians as needed.

3. **Data Analytics**:
   - Collects data on traffic patterns, congestion levels, and vehicle counts.
   - Provides insights for traffic management and future infrastructure planning.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Web-based dashboard for system configuration, monitoring, and visualization.
   - Alerts and notifications for abnormal situations (e.g., accidents, road closures).

### Technologies Used
- Python (for object detection models)
- OpenCV or TensorFlow (for computer vision)
- Node.js (for backend server)
- Websockets or REST APIs (for communication)
- Node-Red dashboard (for the user interface)

### Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up the required dependencies (Python, Node.js, etc.).
3. Configure camera feeds or video streams.
4. Run the system and monitor traffic data via the web interface.

Note that above informations are subjected to changes.
